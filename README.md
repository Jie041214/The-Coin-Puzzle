To start the game, you can simply open `The Coin Puzzle.exe`.

This game is written in Godot 3.5, and this is my college assignment.

## Introduction
The coin puzzle is a puzzle game. The objective of this game is to insert all the coins into a puzzle in each level, then players will win the game. As the level increases, the puzzles become increasingly complex, so players are required to have a careful thought and creative approaches.
